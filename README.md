# RestingEEG_Features

Matlab scripts for extracting Resting-State EEG features including:
- power spectral densities
- absolute and relative power in fixed frequency bands (i.e. delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and subbands
- individual alpha frequency based on different methods (maximum, derivative, gravity method)
- absolute and relative power in individual frequency bands (with respect to individual alpha frequency)
